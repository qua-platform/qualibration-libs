class QubitGrid:
    """Creates a grid object where the qubits are placed.
    Accepts a dataset whose dimension 'qubit' is used as the dimension on which the grid is built.
    It also accepts a parameter "grid_names" that specifies syntax for the position of each qubit on the grid. If none
    it assumes that qubit names are of the form: 'q-i,j' where i,j are integers describing the x and y coordinates of the grid.

    Iteration of the resulting grid can be done using 'grid_iter' defined in lib.plot_utils.

    :param ds: The dataset containing the names of the qubit under ds.qubit
    :params grid_names: a list of names in the required qubit names, in case the qubits names
                        given in a different format. Default is None

    :var fig: the created figure object
    :var all_axes: all the created axes, used and unused

    :name_dicts: a list containing the names of the qubit, taken from ds.qubit, in the
                convention of FacetGrid dict_names

    usage example:
    Assume we have a dataset with a data variable I, and a data coordinate q formated
    according to the naming convention. A way to plot the data on the grid would be
